\begin{abstract}
In this article, we establish an affine paving for partial flag quiver varieties when the quiver is of Dynkin type. By copying results in \cite[section 6]{irelli2019cell} word by word, the same problem for affine quiver reduced to the case where the representation is regular quasi-simple. The idea of the proof mainly comes from \cite{irelli2019cell}, and the result is a natural continuation of \cite{maksimau2019flag}.

\section{Introduction}
Let $Q$ be a quiver of Dynkin or affine type(without loops), $X\in \Rep(Q)$ be an quiver representation.\footnote{We fix the base field $K=\mathbb{C}$ for convinience.} We are interested in three objects related to $X \in \Rep(Q)$:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
&	\text{quiver Grassmannian} && \Grq(X)\colon = \left\{ M_1 \mid M_1 \subseteq X \right\}\\
&	\text{partial flag variety \textcolor{gray}{$d\geqslant 1$}} && \Flagd(X)\colon =\left\{ 0 \subseteq M_1 \subseteq \cdots M_d \subseteq X \right\}\\
&	\text{strict partial flag variety \textcolor{gray}{$d\geqslant 2$}} && \Flagdstr(X)\colon =\left\{ 0 \subseteq M_1 \subseteq \cdots M_d \subseteq X  \mid x.M_{i+1} \subseteq M_i\right\}\footnotemark\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\footnotetext{for any $x \in Q_1, i \in \{2,\ldots ,d \} $.}

It's easy to see that $\Flag{1}(X)=\Grq(X)$. These geometrical objects can be divided into different pieces according to the dimension vectors of $M_1,\ldots,M_d$, and each piece have its own natural (complex/Zarisky) topology. It was proved in \cite{irelli2019cell} that $\Grq(X)$ have an affine paving, and in \cite{maksimau2019flag} that $\Flagd(X)$ have the same property when $Q$ is Dynkin quiver of type $A/E$. Here we go one step further, the results are concluded in the ???.

???Here is one table

The idea of proof is very simple: first, we view the partial flag quiver variety as the quiver Grassmannian of the more complicated quiver; then we establish the decomposition so that one may solve the problem by induction; finally we set a special way of decomposition for each indecomposable module so that we can avoid meeting the bad decomposition. These contents are in Section ???, accordingly.
